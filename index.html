<p> Gordon Ramsay, born on November 8th, 1966, in Johnstone UK, is a renowned chef, he is known from his many appearences on television and internet videos. His most notable show to date is Hell's Kitchen where he has built up a reputation as a very strict and volatile head chef.
He has on multiple occasions yelled at and publicly punished the contestants on his show, examples include </p>
<ul>
  <li> Dumping entire entrees into the trash </li>
  <li> Brining all the contestants to look at another teammates mistake </li>
  <li> Removes all the contestants from the kitchen and proceeds to clean up the mistakes himself </li>
  <li> Shuts down any talk back immediately </li>
</ul>
<p>
But contrary to all this he is actually a compassionate and understanding chef. He hosts another show by the name of MasterChef Junior, where he is shown to be understanding to the struggles of the younger chefs.
In this show, sometimes the young chefs make mistakes and potentially ruin a dish, when this happens, instead of acting with irritation, he tries to calm down the child and teach them the correct ways. He is only
unsympathetic toward the adult chefs, who have trained for a majority of their life, and still make mistakes in the kitchen. I personally admire his understanding that kids will kids and that the adults have no
true excuse for the unacceptable blunders they produce in the kitchen.</p>
